## Overview

DroneX allows users to order groceries, essentials, or consumer products through an intuitive app interface. Payments are securely routed through a **smart escrow contract**, holding funds until delivery confirmation. The platform leverages **AI-powered algorithms** and **Gazebo simulation** to select the most suitable drone for each delivery, optimizing for location, battery, and operational availability.
